The `F`-lang is used for system bootstrap and first stage scripting. It is based
on the FORTH language concepts as **the simplest programming language can ever
be** made by any unskilled programmer, but raises it towards an object approach
and trying to fix most ugly things like direct memory bytes addressing for doing
anything.
